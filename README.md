# 2026-Stream

[Add description of app functionality so far]

# Getting started

Make sure you have Node.js on your computer. Make sure you have Expo Go installed on your phone. 

Git clone the repo from github. 

Open the 2026-Stream directory on your computer. Use `cd homeflow` to get to the homeflow directory. Once you're there, run this command:

npx expo start

Now, scan the QR code and test the app!

**Important**: Make sure that your phone and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network (otherwise, you won't be able to get the QR code!)

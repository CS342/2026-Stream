# Getting Started with HomeFlow

This guide will help you set up and run your app.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment file and add your keys
cp .env.example .env

# Start the development server
npm start
```

## Environment Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values:

### Local Storage

Your app uses local AsyncStorage for data persistence.
No cloud configuration is required.

> **Note:** Data is stored on-device only. Users cannot sync
> across devices, and data is lost when the app is uninstalled.

### AI Chat Configuration

Your app includes the Chat feature with AI integration.

> **⚠️ Security Warning:** API keys are exposed client-side in
> React Native apps. For production, implement a backend proxy
> to keep your keys secure.

Get API keys for your selected providers:

- **OpenAI**: [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

Add the keys to your `.env` file:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

### HealthKit Setup (iOS Only)

Your app includes Apple HealthKit integration for health data access.

> **⚠️ Important:** HealthKit requires a custom development build.
> It will NOT work in Expo Go.

#### Building for iOS:

```bash
# Create native iOS project and run
npx expo prebuild --platform ios
npx expo run:ios

# Or use EAS Build
eas build --platform ios --profile development
```

#### Testing:

- Use a **physical iOS device** for best results
- Simulator has limited HealthKit support
- Add test data: Simulator → Features → Health → Health Data

#### Configuration:

Edit `lib/healthkit-config.ts` to customize which health metrics to collect.

## Your App Features

Based on your selections, your app includes:

- **Local Storage** - On-device data persistence
- **Chat** - AI-powered chat interface with LLM integration
- **Scheduler** - Recurring tasks and reminder management
- **Questionnaires** - FHIR-compliant health forms
- **HealthKit** - Apple Health data integration (iOS only)

## Running on Devices

# iOS Simulator
npm run ios

# Android Emulator

```

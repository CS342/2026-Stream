/**
 * HealthKit Service
 *
 * Clean abstraction for Apple HealthKit data queries.
 * Uses @kingstinct/react-native-healthkit under the hood.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   import { requestHealthPermissions, getDailyActivity, getSleep, getVitals } from '@/lib/services/healthkit';
 *
 * All data collection is gated behind explicit user consent via requestHealthPermissions().
 * No health data is logged in production. Data is normalized to simple units.

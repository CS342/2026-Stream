Protocol Title: Home Uroflow Bladder Outlet Study
Protocol Director (PI): Ryan Sun, MD
IRB Number: IRB# -----

STUDY OVERVIEW
You are invited to participate in a research study on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and lower urinary tract symptoms. This study is being conducted at Stanford University to evaluate whether relief of bladder outlet obstruction can improve objective quality of life and activity measures using wearable devices and home uroflow measurement.

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
The purpose of this research is to determine whether improvement in bladder outlet obstruction is associated with measurable improvements in daily activity, sleep, and urinary flow patterns. The results may help improve diagnosis and guide treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms.

STUDY PROCEDURES
If you choose to participate, you will be asked to take part in the following:
- Registration and setup, including study screening, consent, initial surveys, and mobile application setup (approximately 30 minutes).
- Use of a wearable device (such as a smartwatch) that you already own. You will be asked to wear the device daily and allow data collected by the device to be shared with the study team through a Stanford-designed research application.
- Installation and use of a smart toilet–based uroflow measurement device (Throne One) attached to your home toilet. You will be asked to record as many voids as possible during a one-week period.
- Completion of survey questionnaires collecting demographic information, medical history, and urinary symptoms, including follow-up surveys at 1 and 12 weeks after surgery.
- Sharing of medical information from your medical record and from other health systems through Apple Health and related integrations, with your permission.

RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS
The risks associated with this study include the time required to download, set up, and use the mobile applications and devices. There is a very small risk of inadvertent disclosure of private health information related to your voiding or wearable data. Although safeguards are in place, there is a small risk of data security breaches.

BENEFITS
You may not receive any direct benefit from participating in this study. The potential benefit is contributing to research that may improve understanding of voiding dysfunction and help develop better diagnostic and treatment tools for future patients.

PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION
Your data will be handled securely and used only for research purposes. Identifiable information may be removed, and de-identified data may be used for future research studies or shared with other investigators without additional consent. All reasonable efforts will be made to protect your privacy.

COMPENSATION
You will receive $100 for successful completion of the study.

VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION
Your participation in this study is voluntary. You may choose not to participate or to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. Your decision will not affect your medical care.
